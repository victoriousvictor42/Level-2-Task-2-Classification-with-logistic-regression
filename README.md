# üéØ Level 2, Task 2: Classification with Logistic Regression

## üìò **Project Overview**

This project focuses on applying **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning, to categorize data points into distinct classes based on predictor variables. Logistic Regression is widely used for binary and multi-class classification problems due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency.

The notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a classification model ‚Äî from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, performance evaluation, and result interpretation.

## üéØ **Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to implement and evaluate a **Logistic Regression model** for classification tasks.
Specific goals include:

1. To perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** to prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. To conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand feature relationships.
3. To **train a Logistic Regression model** for classification.
4. To evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics.
5. To interpret and visualize results for better understanding of model behavior.
